# HOLD FARM

__HOLD__ token generates passive income by allocating assets to other crypto farms, combining and picking best farming vaults. You just need to hold the HOLD TOKEN to get profits, cutting messy process of STAKING and doing complex operations.

In Short, __HOLD__ token is backed by best APY asset from autofarm.network 

 
## Definitions :
 
 + __AutoFarm__ - AutoFarm is yet another yield optimizer on the Binance Smart Chain.
 
 + __HOLD__ -  Tokens 
 
 + __HOLDERS__ - Holders are the ones who Hold $HOLD tokens

  + __APR__ ( Annual Percentage Rate ) - APR is the full rate you will be charged throughout your Farming period


 

## Key Aspects :
 
 1. 3% of __HOLD__ is burned on every transaction.
 
 2. Supply increases by 12.96 __HOLD__.
 
 3. Epoch Time is 6 hours
 
 
## Theory :
 
  Since __HOLD__ Token is deflationary ( 1.1 ), we need to inflate it in some way and use that inflation (1.2) for farming.Every __Epoch__ New __HOLD__ are minted and then swapped to the best-performing asset on $AUTOFARM ( or similar farms )
 
 Example Assets APR on Autofarm :
 
 + BNB 60% APR 
 + CAKE 300% APR
 + USDT 30% APR
 
 
  Now since CAKE has Highest __APR__, it's the best-returning Asset to invest in, Now controller will swap __HOLD__ generated in (1.2) to CAKE. Now the controller has __CAKE__ and it will Invest them in __Autofarm__ which will start generating returns With time our asset grows
 
## Example :
 
 + We invested 10000 CAKE and after 6 hours its 10040 CAKE these 40 CAKE interest that we generated will be used to buy back __HOLD__ elevating price for all __HOLDERS__.This makes it a invite loop that keeps buying back __HOLD TOKEN__ and elevating its value over time



## Fees
