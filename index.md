In Short, __HOLD__ token is backed by best APY asset from autofarm.network 

 
## Definitions :
 
 + __AutoFarm__ - AutoFarm is yet another yield optimizer on the Binance Smart Chain.
 
 + __HOLD__ -  Tokens 
 
 + __HOLDERS__ - Holders are the ones who Hold $HOLD tokens

  + __APR__ ( Annual Percentage Rate ) - APR is the full rate you will be charged throughout your Farming period


 

## Key Aspects :
 
 1. 3% of __HOLD__ is burned on every transaction.
 
 2. Supply increases by __12.96 HOLD__.
 
 3. Epoch Time is __6 hours__
 
 
## Theory :
 
  Since __HOLD__ Token is deflationary ( 1.1 ), we need to inflate it in some way and use that inflation (1.2) for farming.Every __Epoch__ New __HOLD__ are minted and then swapped to the best-performing asset on $AUTOFARM ( or similar farms )
 
 Example Assets APR on Autofarm :
 
 + BNB 60% APR 
 + CAKE 300% APR
 + USDT 30% APR
 
 
Now since CAKE has Highest __APR__, it's the best-returning Asset to invest in, Now controller will swap __HOLD__ generated in (1.2) to CAKE. Now the controller has __CAKE__ and it will Invest them in __Autofarm__ which will start generating returns With time our asset grows
 
## Example :
 
We invested 10000 CAKE and after 6 hours its 10040 CAKE these 40 CAKE interest that we generated will be used to buy back __HOLD__ elevating price for all __HOLDERS__.This makes it a infinite loop that keeps buying back __HOLD TOKEN__ and elevating its value over time
